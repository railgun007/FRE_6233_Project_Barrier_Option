FRE 6233 Option Pricing Final Project about Barrier Option with Rebate
In this paper, our main task is to solve the price of down-and-out call option with rebate and down-and-in put option with rebate using PDE method.
In part I, we illustrate what are the assumptions and set-ups for this report.
For part II, we derive the price formula of barrier options first from simple vanilla option, and use reflection method for simple Down and out barrier option, then extending the formula to all barrier options by taking the strike price K and the barrier X into consideration. The target we have here is the pricing formula for down-and-out call with rebate and down-and-out put with rebate, so we have also derived the formula for European digital call and put with barrier. We replicate the value of barrier option with rebate by constituting the portfolio of normal barrier option and European digital call and put with barrier.
For part III, we plot the price of Down-and-out call and Down-and-in put against moneyness and have made a detailed illustration for the insight
In part IV, we price the option using Monte Carlo simulation to double check the validity of our deriving formula, and in this case, we just check down-and-out call with rebate and Down-and-in put with rebate.
For part V, we calculate the delta by using numerical method and a single stock is picked to examine the profit and loss of our delta hedging strategy.
